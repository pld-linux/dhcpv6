 .B dhcp6s.conf
-contains the configuration information of addresses, prefixes, or
-various network configuration parameters for each of the interfaces. 
-The network configuration parameters can be described globally for all of 
-the interfaces. The default address preferred life time is 36000 seconds; 
-the default address valid life time is 72000 seconds if they are not defined
-in any declaration. The specific declaration order is interface, link, host;
-within link the more specific declaration is pool.
-
- The interface definitions are described in the following form:
-.PP
-.nf
-.B \tinterface\ <interface\ name>
-.B \t{
-.B \t\t[declarations];
-.B \t};
-.fi
- where each of the declarations could be of type link, group, or host. 
-Each declaration and the statements within each of these declarations 
-must be terminated by a semicolon. Additional details of the declarations 
-are specified below.

-.PP
-.BI DECLARATIONS
-.PP
-.nf
-.B interface\ <interface\ name>
-.B {
-.B \t[declarations];
-.B };
-.fi
-An interface declaration is used to inform the DHCPv6 server that the links and
-hosts declared within it are connected to the same network segment. Common
-network parameters for this network segment can be defined within the interface
-declaration.
-
-.nf
-.B link\ <link\ name>
-.B {
-.B \t[declarations];
-.B };
-.fi
-A link declaration is used to provide the DHCPv6 server  the IPv6 assgined
-address ranges, prefixes, and hosts. Common network parameters for this link 
-can be defined within the link declaration.
-
-.nf
-.B group
-.B {
-.B \t[declarations];
-.B };
-.fi
-A group declaration is used to group a list of declarations together to define
-the common network parameters. These network parameters are valid within this
-declaration only. Declarations can be one of the following types: interface, link,
-pool, or host.
-
-.nf
-.B pool
-.B {
-.B \t[declarations];
-.B };
-.fi
-The pool declaration is used to declare an address pool from which IPv6
-address can be allocated, with its own permit to control client access
-and its own declaration in which you can declare pool-specific network parameters.
-
-.nf
-.B host\ <host\ name>
-.B {
-.B \t[duid\ <DUID\n>];

-client. Usually DHCPv6 clients must use multicast addresses to contact DHCPv6
-server and agents. With this declaration, dhcp6s accepts unicast 
-messages from DHCPv6 clients if they include a Server Unicast option.

+contains the configuration information of addresses, prefixes, or
+various network configuration parameters for each of the interfaces. 
+The network configuration parameters can be described globally for all of 
+the interfaces. The default address preferred life time is 36000 seconds; 
+the default address valid life time is 72000 seconds if they are not defined
+in any declaration. The specific declaration order is interface, link, host;
+within link the more specific declaration is pool.
+
+ The interface definitions are described in the following form:
+.PP
+.nf
+.B \tinterface\ <interface\ name>
+.B \t{
+.B \t\t[declarations];
+.B \t};
+.fi
+ where each of the declarations could be of type link, group, or host. 
+Each declaration and the statements within each of these declarations 
+must be terminated by a semicolon. Additional details of the declarations 
+are specified below.
+
+.PP
+.BI DECLARATIONS
+.PP
+.nf
+.B interface\ <interface\ name>
+.B {
+.B \t[declarations];
+.B };
+.fi
+An interface declaration is used to inform the DHCPv6 server that the links and
+hosts declared within it are connected to the same network segment. Common
+network parameters for this network segment can be defined within the interface
+declaration.
+
+.nf
+.B link\ <link\ name>
+.B {
+.B \t[declarations];
+.B };
+.fi
+A link declaration is used to provide the DHCPv6 server  the IPv6 assgined
+address ranges, prefixes, and hosts. Common network parameters for this link 
+can be defined within the link declaration.
+
+.nf
+.B group
+.B {
+.B \t[declarations];
+.B };
+.fi
+A group declaration is used to group a list of declarations together to define
+the common network parameters. These network parameters are valid within this
+declaration only. Declarations can be one of the following types: interface, link,
+pool, or host.
+
+.nf
+.B pool
+.B {
+.B \t[declarations];
+.B };
+.fi
+The pool declaration is used to declare an address pool from which IPv6
+address can be allocated, with its own permit to control client access
+and its own declaration in which you can declare pool-specific network parameters.
+
+.nf
+.B host\ <host\ name>
+.B {
+.B \t[duid\ <DUID\n>];
+.B \t[iaidinfo\ {}];
+.B \t[address\ {}];
+.B \t[prefix\ <prefix>/<prefix\ length>];
+.B \t[declarations];
+.B };
+.fi
+This declaration allows administrators to describe the addresses, prefixes, and
+network configuration parameters for this  host. As for this declaration, the
+DHCP Unique Identifier (DUID), Identity Association Identifier (IAID), and 
+addresses must be specified. The host declaration is used to do Static
+Address Assginment for a particular DHCPv6 client. 
+
+.nf
+.B address
+.B {
+.B \t[<ipv6 address>/<prefix length>];
+.B \t[prefer-life-time\ <preferred\ lifetime>];
+.B \t[valid-life-time\ <valid\ lifetime>];
+.B };
+.fi
+This statement allows administrators to specify the address for the 
+host. Preferred Lifetime and Valid Lifetime also can be set in this
+statement. This statement is valid only in host {} declarations.
+
+.nf
+.B prefix\ <prefix>/<prefix\ length>;
+.fi
+This statement allows administrators to specify the prefix.
+This parameter is needed when configuring dhcp6s as the Delegation Router for
+the Prefix Delegation. dhcp6s assigns the specified prefixes 
+to the requesting routers.
+
+.nf
+.B relay\ <relay>/<prefix\ length>;
+.fi
+This statement specifies the prefix that the relay agent will put in the link
+address field of the RELAY-FORW message to indicate the link the client is
+attached to. If the link-address matches this prefix, this link declaration
+will be used. This statement is only valid in the link declaration.
+
+.nf
+.B iaidinfo
+.B {
+.B \t[iaid\ <IAID\ number>];
+.B \t[renew-time\ <renew\ time>];
+.B \t[rebind-time\ <rebind\ time>];
+.B };
+.fi
+This statement allows administrators to describe the information for 
+this IAID. This statement is only valid in host {} declarations.
+iaid is required; renew-time and rebind time are optional in this statement.
+
+.nf
+.B range\ <ipv6\ address>\ to\ <ipv6\ address>/<prefix\ length>;
+.fi
+This statement allows adminstrators to use "range" and "to" keywords and
+prefix length to specify an address range.
+For each range not more than one of the unassigned addresses will be
+assgined to the requested client.
+
+.nf
+.B duid\ <DUID\>;
+.fi
+DUID is a DHCP Unique Identifier for a DHCP participant. Using this option,
+the administrator can specify the DUID of this DHCPv6 client.
+The duid statement is valid only in host {} declarations.
+
+.nf
+.BI iaid\ <IAID\ number>;
+.fi
+IAID is a Identity Association Identifier. IA is a collection of addresses
+assigned to a client. Using this option, the administrator can specify the IAID
+in iaidinfo for a host declaration.
+
+.nf
+.BI renew-time\ <renew\ time>;
+.fi
+This statement allows administrators to specify the RenewTime (T1).
+The recommended value for RenewTime is .5 times the shortest preferred
+lifetime of the address in the IA, if the value is not defined.
+
+.nf
+.BI rebind-time\ <rebind\ time>;
+.fi
+This statement allows administrators to specify the RebindTime (T2).
+The recommended value for RenewTime is .8 times the shortest preferred 
+lifetime of the address in the IA, if the value is not defined.
+
+.nf
+.BI prefer-life-time\ <preferred\ lifetime>;
+.fi
+This statement allows administrators to specify the Preferred Life Time for 
+each address.
+
+.nf
+.BI valid-life-time\ <valid\ lifetime>;
+.fi
+This statement allows administrators to specify the Valid Life Time for 
+each address.
+
+.nf
+.BI option\ dns_server\ <ipv6\ addresses\ or\ domain\ name\ list>;
+.fi
+This statement allows administrators to specify the DNS servers.
+
+.B send\ <OPTION>;
+.fi
+This declaration enables dhcp6s to include the specified option in sending 
+DHCPv6 messages.
+
+.nf
+\fIsend\ unicast;\fR
+.fi
+This declaration enables dhcp6s to send a Server Unicast option. Usually
+DHCPv6 clients must use multicast addresses to contact the DHCPv6 server and
+agents. This declaration specifies that dhcp6s will accept unicast messages
+from DHCPv6 clients if they include a Server Unicast option.
+
+.nf
+\fIserver-preference\ <server\ preference\ value>;\fR
+.fi
+This declaration enables dhcp6s to include a Preference option for sending
+DHCPv6 messages. DHCPv6 clients will pick up the DHCPv6 server which has
+highest preference value. The highest preference value is 255.
+
+.nf
+\fIsend\ temp-address;\fR
+.fi
+This declaration assigns a temporary address to the requesting client.
+
+.nf
+\fIsend\ information-only;\fR
+.fi
+This option enables dhcp6s to give only configuration information rather than
+assigning client addresses. This could be, for example, DNS server address
+configuration information.
+
+.nf
+.B allow\ <OPTION>;
+.fi
+This declaration allows the DHCPv6 client to specify an option in receiving
+DHCPv6 messages.
+
+.nf
+\fIallow rapid\-commit;\fR
+.fi
+This option enables dhcp6s to allow the Rapid-Commit option from the DHCPv6
+client and the Solicit-Reply message exchanges.
+
+.nf
+\fIallow\ unicast;\fR
+.fi
+This option enables dhcp6s to allow the Server Unicast option for the DHCPv6
+client. Usually DHCPv6 clients must use multicast addresses to contact DHCPv6
+server and agents. With this declaration, dhcp6s accepts unicast 
+messages from DHCPv6 clients if they include a Server Unicast option.
+
+
+.nf
+\fIuse-ra-prefix;\fR
+.fi
+This declaration tells the server not to send clients the address prefix configured
+in address or range statements. With this option, client address prefixes can
+be set only by router advertisements, and the prefix configured in address or
+range statements will be ignored. This is a Red Hat extension; previously, the
+only way to set client address prefixes was by router advertisement.
